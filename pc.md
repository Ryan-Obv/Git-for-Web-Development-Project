## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
    Git is an Open Source Distributed Version Control System used for tracking changes in any set of files.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?

3. Why do we create a branch?
    Branches allow us to safely experiment with new ideas and make changes in an isolated line of development.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
    The Pull Request updates the local version of a repository from a remote.  Git pull updates the currently checked out branch.

6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
    'git fetch' downloads commits & files from a remote repository into the local repository.
    'git merge' takes the independent lines of development created by the git branch and merges them into a single branch.
    'git pull' downloads content from a remote repository and updates the local repository to match the content.
7. What is a merge conflict?
    Merge conflicts occur when different changes are made to the same line of a file, or when you edit a file that has been deleted by someone else.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
    After resolving any conflicts possible, git commands that will help to resolve merge conflicts include
